Description:
This repository holds the GUI for the 2nd Major Program and holds specific GUI that can be used for the Mower classes. There is a Mower Class Menu that starts off GUI and allows the user to either add, delete, edit, or view the Mower class with different buttons. These buttons lead the user to the other GUI specific to that button (for example, choosing "View Mower", sends the user to the GUI for viewing the mower). Once at the GUI, there is a short description that describes the function and there is a button under it that allows the user to starts a certain action.
